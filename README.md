# 3sum

Presenting using a mic is ancient and obsolete for the current generation. There are issues like resonance. The cost is high for maintenance and its a one way communication. Its like Walkie-Talkie of this day. 3SumE is here to disrupt this market. No capex involved. No maintenance needed. Your phone is your mic and speaker and your entire AV system. With Agora audio/video RTC, we can make events, more podcast-like. Simple to organise | Easy to setup | At no extra cost and maintenance.
